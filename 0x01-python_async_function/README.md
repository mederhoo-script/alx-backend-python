Introduction

Asynchronous programming in Python, particularly with the asyncio module, enables developers to write efficient, non-blocking code that can handle multiple I/O-bound tasks concurrently. By leveraging coroutines, event loops, and async/await syntax, developers can improve the performance and responsiveness of their applications, especially in scenarios involving network communication, file I/O, or interacting with external APIs.
Getting Started

To use the scripts in this repository, ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Each script in this repository demonstrates a specific aspect of asynchronous programming in Python. To run a script, simply execute it using Python:

bash

python script_name.py

Examples
1. coroutine1.py

Description: Demonstrates a basic asyncio coroutine that waits for 1 second before printing a message.

Usage:

bash

python coroutine1.py

2. coroutine2.py

Description: Illustrates another asyncio coroutine that waits for 2 seconds before printing a message.

Usage:

bash

python coroutine2.py

3. concurrent_coroutines.py

Description: Shows how to run multiple coroutines concurrently using asyncio.gather().

Usage:

bash

python concurrent_coroutines.py

Feel free to explore other examples in the repository to gain a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming in Python.
